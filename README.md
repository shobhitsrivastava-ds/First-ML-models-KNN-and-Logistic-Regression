# First-ML-models-KNN-and-Logistic-Regression
Well,finally after a lot of hard work on data analysis,finally my first ML model is here, which is trained on Iris dataset obtained from sklearn_dataset.
According to which,the prediction is on Data with the four different species of the Flowers.
The observation which the data include is of the Sepal's length and width,Petal's length and width.
The models chosen for the superviosed Classification training is K-nearest neighbour and Logistic Regression.
->The first estimation is based on training the model with any random array of data fed,
->the second one is on the trained data itself and ,
->in the third one the model is trained with half of the left over data set(40% of the whole data).
There is also two Evaluating result accuracy round,according to which the Accuracy percentage is taken out.
So,this is all.
Waiting for more to come soon......
Thank you !
